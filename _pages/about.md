The IEEE UofT ASIC Team is a specialized project team within the IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch, dedicated to providing hands-on integrated circuit design experience to undergraduate students.

## ASICs?
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the cornerstone of modern electronics. These (mostly) tiny devices are foundational to our digital society. The process of fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) is known as taping out, or tapeout for [historical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out#Naming).

## Overview
The ASIC Team works to provide IC design experience and opportunities to Undergraduate students at the University of Toronto. The students touch and skim through the different aspects of IC design throughout their Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum, but are seldom given the opportunity to practically apply these skills to design and fabricate their own IC. 

The ASIC Team utilizes the amazing [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) and Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) [community](https://fossi-foundation.org/) to facilitate these opportunities. We use Open Source Software (OSS) for digital, mixed-signal, and analog IC design.

## Who are we?
We are a Project Team of the IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch focused on producing technical projects in the field of ICs. The team is primarily composed of third and fourth year students studying ECE. 

## What do we do? 
### Learning
Most students don't come in with experience using Open Source tooling for IC design. We focus on providing the required background to get familiar with the toolchain. This manifests in weekly learning sessions which expose students to relevant examples and "labs" that give them practical experience using tools like LibreLane.

### Designing
Every associate on our team is passionate about creating their own integrated circuits. Throughout the year, members participate in learning sessions to get familiar with open source IC toolchains. Using this knowledge, each member prototypes their own proposed design in our ASIC Kompetition. The winning designs are chosen through internal voting, and the entire team comes together to tapeout these chips through TinyTapeout.

### Building a Community
The purpose of the ASIC team is to build a passionate community of IC designers at the University of Toronto. We run events like the IC job mixer, introducing students to the ASIC design flow and different career paths in this field. We also host workshops and paper reviews open to the broader student body, covering topics like asynchronous circuits and AI-assisted EDA.

## Our Mission
1. Creating practical IC Design Opportunities for Students
2. Contributing back to the Open Source Silicon Community  
3. Creating Resources for interested parties in IC design

## About Our Team
We have a team of 18 engineering undergrads joining as associates, with 2 directors leading the initiative. Our events have tremendous impact, with community events reaching 60+ students in attendance, and over 100 students applied to join the team. We are thrilled that the passion for ICs and electronics continues to grow stronger at UofT.

## Previous Projects
This is now the second year of the ASIC team. The first year was a trial run to build the grassroots. The product of our first year was a DPLL project, which is slated to be taped out on the TT-Sky-25b shuttle.

## Technical Stack
Due to the limited availability and high cost of proprietary IC design software, the team has adopted an open source tech stack, utilizing resources and tools from the amazing FOSSi community:

- **Process Node**: SKY130
- **Toolchain Flow**: LibreLane  
- **Tooling**: Open Circuit Design
- **Tapeout Provider**: TinyTapeout
