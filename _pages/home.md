# IEEE UofT ASIC Team

Welcome to the website of the IEEE University of Toronto ASIC Team. This website will host an introduction to the team, a series of technical blog reports on the work the team has accomplished, and relevant documentation pertaining to the team.

## ASICs?
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the cornerstone of modern electronics. These (mostly) tiny devices are foundational to our digital society. The process of fabricating Integrated Circuits (ICs) is known as taping out, or tapeout for [historical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out#Naming).

## Overview
The ASIC Team works to provide IC design experience and opportunities to Undergraduate students at the University of Toronto. The students touch and skim through the different aspects of IC design throughout their Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum, but are seldom given the opportunity to practically apply these skills to design and fabricate their own IC. 

The ASIC Team utilizes the amazing [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) and Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) [community](https://fossi-foundation.org/) to facilitate these opportunities. We use Open Source Software (OSS) for digital, mixed-signal, and analog IC design.

## Who are we?
We are a Project Team of the IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch focused on producing technical projects in the field of ICs. The team is primarily composed of third and fourth year students studying ECE. 

## What do we do? 
### Learning
Most students don't come in with experience using Open Source tooling for IC design. We focus on providing the required background to get familiar with the toolchain. This manifests in weekly learning sessions which expose students to relevant examples and "labs" that give them practical experience using tools like LibreLane.

### Designing
Every associate on our team is passionate about creating their own 

### Building a Community
